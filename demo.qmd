## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
plot(1:1)
```

```{r}
library(plotly)

data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/school_earnings.csv")

fig <- plot_ly(data, x = ~Women, y = ~Men, text = ~School, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers',
        marker = list(size = ~Gap, opacity = 0.5))
fig <- fig %>% layout(title = 'Gender Gap in Earnings per University',
         xaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE))

fig
```
